# Vintage Story Mod - Universal Husbandry
## Description
Adds a new map layer that show the first rock blocks in the world

## How it works
This mod is heavily based on the default terrain map code ([ChunkMapLayer](https://github.com/anegostudios/vsessentialsmod/blob/e9dbc197df1a329b5b8789e2aa086b525ff4d3c8/Systems/WorldMap/ChunkLayer/ChunkMapLayer.cs)) and tweaked to check for the first stone block instead of the first surface block.

## Bugs and Problems
If you find any bug just submit an issue with a good description of the bug, and how to replicate it.
